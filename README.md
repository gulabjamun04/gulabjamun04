## **Certifications to Add (Optional but Valuable)**

Complete these **free** certificates to boost credibility:

1. **DeepLearning.AI - LangChain Series** (4 courses)
   - Add each as separate certification on LinkedIn
   - ~12 hours total, completely free

2. **Hugging Face NLP Course**
   - Add completion badge to LinkedIn

3. **Google Cloud Skills Boost - Generative AI**
   - Free, recognized certificate

*Add these to LinkedIn "Licenses & Certifications" section*

## **Interview Talking Points**

When asked about GenAI skills, you can confidently say:

✅ **"I've built 6 production GenAI applications covering RAG, fine-tuning, agents, and multi-modal AI"**

✅ **"I've deployed LLM-powered APIs handling hundreds of concurrent users with sub-2 second latency"**

✅ **"I've fine-tuned Llama 3.1 achieving 92% accuracy, reducing API costs by 60% vs GPT-4"**

✅ **"I've implemented advanced RAG systems with hybrid search, improving retrieval accuracy by 35%"**

✅ **"I understand when to use RAG vs fine-tuning vs prompt engineering based on use case"**

✅ **"I've worked with OpenAI, Anthropic, and open-source models like Llama and Mistral"**

---

## **What NOT to Claim**

Be honest about limitations:

❌ Don't say: "Expert in GenAI" (15 days isn't enough)
✅ Say: "Experienced in building production GenAI applications"

❌ Don't say: "Deep learning researcher"
✅ Say: "Applied ML engineer focused on LLM applications"

❌ Don't claim skills you didn't actually use in projects
✅ Only list tools/frameworks you've actually built something with
